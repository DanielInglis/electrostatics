# Electrostatics Solver

Third year Theoretical Physics group project to solve electrostatics problems.


### Document Structure

##### bin
The bin directory is where the output executables are stored. It is listed in .gitignore so that it is not included in the git repository. (You generate it along with the compiled executables by running make.)

##### build
Like the bin directory, the build directory is not included in the git repository but is automatically generated by running make. It contains the compiled (but not linked) .o object files.

##### include
All header files should be in the include folder. 

##### src
The src folder is for all c++ source files. These should all have the file extension .cpp (so that that make can find them).


### Compiling and Running

To compile and run the program you must have g++, make and eigen installed. Eigen is the library used to provide matrices.

##### Installing g++ and make
On a Debian based system run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ make
```

##### Installing Eigen
```bash
wget http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.2.7.tar.gz -O eigen.tar.gz
tar zxpf eigen.tar.gz
sudo mv eigen-eigen-b30b87236a1b /usr/local/include/eigen
```

##### Compiling
In the root directory of the project run make. This will generate the object files in the build directory, and the output executable in the bin directory
```bash
make
```

##### Running the Program
```bash
bin/electrostatics
```
